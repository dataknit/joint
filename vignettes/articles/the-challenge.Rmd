```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(joint)
```

From the three "target" distributions:

```{r}
age_lsoa |> head()
```

```{r}
age_disability_la |> head()
```

```{r}
age_nssec_la |> head()
```

create a joint distribution

```{r}
joint <- tidyr::crossing(age_lsoa$lsoa,
                         age_disability_la$disability_3_categories,
                         age_nssec_la$nssec_10_categories) |>
  mutate(n = NA_real_)
joint |> head()
```

that aligns with the target distributions.
